    This is a scenario based solution which implemented in Python.
    Used selection sort to sort the bulk object list(with considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
    
    After iserting another record to sorted list, according to the scenario solution is used 
    Isertion sort to order the list again. 
    
    Regarding the user input validations, I've added length validations for  both Student Number and Course Code
    and also handleg the Value Errors on it.
    
    Flow of the code...
    First I've given privileges to user in order to register the students, then sorted the student object list
    according to the selection sort, after that code will ask to add more sudents. Based on the user input code will 
    add another student record or stop the execition with printing the lowest student number record and returning the remaining 
    sorted object list. Further I've added random student generator also with the help of random package of the Phython.
