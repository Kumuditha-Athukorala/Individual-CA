This is a scenario-based solution implemented in Python.
Used selection sort to sort the bulk object list(with considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.    
After inserting another record to a sorted list, according to the scenario solution is used Insertion sort to order the list again. 
Regarding the user input validations, I've added length validations for both Student Number and Course Code and also handled the Value Errors on it.    
The flow of the code...
First I've given privileges to users to register the students, then sorted the student object list
According to the selection sort, after that code will ask to add more students. Based on the user input code will add another student record or stop the execution by printing the lowest student number record and returning the remaining sorted object list. Further, I've added a random student generator also with the help of a random package of the Python.
